## My process

I first set out organizing the HTML in a logical way, adhering to best practices.
Regarding styling i first set out all the css cutom properties i would use.
I designed the site from a mobile first perspective, using Grid and media queries to adjust to desktop mode.

For the success message I used a little javascript to make the success message visible on form submission.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

More practice using custom properties and some CSS pseudo properties. I also used the HTML Picture tag for the first time
